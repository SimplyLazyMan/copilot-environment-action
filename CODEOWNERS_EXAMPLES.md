# CODEOWNERS Configuration Examples

This file shows different ways to configure code ownership for your organization.

## Basic Configuration (Current)

The current CODEOWNERS file assigns @Joy-sameza as the owner for all files.

## Team-Based Ownership Examples

If you have GitHub teams in your organization, you can assign team ownership:

```bash
# Replace individual with team ownership
* @Joy-sameza/core-team

# Different teams for different areas
src/ @Joy-sameza/developers
.github/workflows/ @Joy-sameza/devops
docs/ @Joy-sameza/documentation-team
```

## Multi-Owner Configuration

For shared ownership across multiple people:

```bash
# Multiple individual owners for everything
* @Joy-sameza @co-maintainer @lead-dev

# Different owners for different areas
src/ @Joy-sameza @lead-developer
.github/workflows/ @Joy-sameza @devops-engineer
docs/ @Joy-sameza @technical-writer
```

## Granular Ownership Examples

For fine-grained control over specific components:

```bash
# Global fallback
* @Joy-sameza

# Specific source directories
src/managers/ @Joy-sameza @backend-specialist
src/utils/ @Joy-sameza @utility-expert
src/types/ @Joy-sameza @typescript-lead

# Critical files requiring multiple approvals
action.yml @Joy-sameza @architecture-team
package.json @Joy-sameza @security-team
.github/workflows/release.yml @Joy-sameza @release-manager
```

## Organization Team Structure Example

For a larger organization with dedicated teams:

```bash
# Default ownership
* @Joy-sameza/maintainers

# Source code ownership by expertise
src/managers/ @Joy-sameza/backend-team
src/utils/ @Joy-sameza/core-team
src/types/ @Joy-sameza/typescript-team

# Infrastructure and DevOps
.github/workflows/ @Joy-sameza/devops-team
Dockerfile* @Joy-sameza/devops-team
docker-compose.yml @Joy-sameza/devops-team

# Documentation and user-facing content
README.md @Joy-sameza/docs-team
ORGANIZATION_USAGE.md @Joy-sameza/docs-team
docs/ @Joy-sameza/docs-team

# Security and compliance
SECURITY.md @Joy-sameza/security-team
LICENSE @Joy-sameza/legal-team

# Release management (requires multiple approvals)
.github/workflows/release.yml @Joy-sameza/release-team @Joy-sameza/security-team
package.json @Joy-sameza/release-team @Joy-sameza/security-team
```

## To Customize Your CODEOWNERS

1. **Create GitHub Teams** (if using team ownership):
   - Go to your organization settings
   - Create teams like `@Joy-sameza/core-team`, `@Joy-sameza/devops`, etc.
   - Add members to appropriate teams

2. **Edit the CODEOWNERS file**:
   - Replace `@Joy-sameza` with your team or additional usernames
   - Add specific rules for different file patterns
   - Test with pull requests to ensure it works

3. **Enable Branch Protection** (recommended):
   - Go to repository Settings â†’ Branches
   - Add protection rules requiring CODEOWNER reviews
   - This enforces that code owners must approve changes

## Testing CODEOWNERS

After setting up, test by:

1. Creating a pull request that modifies different file types
2. Verify that the correct owners are automatically requested for review
3. Check that the review requirements are enforced

## Benefits of Proper CODEOWNERS

- **Automatic Review Assignment**: No manual assignment needed
- **Expertise Routing**: Changes go to the right people
- **Quality Control**: Critical files get proper oversight  
- **Documentation**: Clear ownership boundaries
- **Compliance**: Audit trail of who reviewed what
