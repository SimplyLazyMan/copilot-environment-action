# CODEOWNERS Configuration Examples

This file shows different ways to configure code ownership for your organization.

## Basic Configuration (Current)

The current CODEOWNERS file assigns @SimplyLazyMan as the owner for all files.

## Team-Based Ownership Examples

If you have GitHub teams in your organization, you can assign team ownership:

```bash
# Replace individual with team ownership
* @SimplyLazyMan/core-team

# Different teams for different areas
src/ @SimplyLazyMan/developers
.github/workflows/ @SimplyLazyMan/devops
docs/ @SimplyLazyMan/documentation-team
```

## Multi-Owner Configuration

For shared ownership across multiple people:

```bash
# Multiple individual owners for everything
* @SimplyLazyMan @co-maintainer @lead-dev

# Different owners for different areas
src/ @SimplyLazyMan @lead-developer
.github/workflows/ @SimplyLazyMan @devops-engineer
docs/ @SimplyLazyMan @technical-writer
```

## Granular Ownership Examples

For fine-grained control over specific components:

```bash
# Global fallback
* @SimplyLazyMan

# Specific source directories
src/managers/ @SimplyLazyMan @backend-specialist
src/utils/ @SimplyLazyMan @utility-expert
src/types/ @SimplyLazyMan @typescript-lead

# Critical files requiring multiple approvals
action.yml @SimplyLazyMan @architecture-team
package.json @SimplyLazyMan @security-team
.github/workflows/release.yml @SimplyLazyMan @release-manager
```

## Organization Team Structure Example

For a larger organization with dedicated teams:

```bash
# Default ownership
* @SimplyLazyMan/maintainers

# Source code ownership by expertise
src/managers/ @SimplyLazyMan/backend-team
src/utils/ @SimplyLazyMan/core-team
src/types/ @SimplyLazyMan/typescript-team

# Infrastructure and DevOps
.github/workflows/ @SimplyLazyMan/devops-team
Dockerfile* @SimplyLazyMan/devops-team
docker-compose.yml @SimplyLazyMan/devops-team

# Documentation and user-facing content
README.md @SimplyLazyMan/docs-team
ORGANIZATION_USAGE.md @SimplyLazyMan/docs-team
docs/ @SimplyLazyMan/docs-team

# Security and compliance
SECURITY.md @SimplyLazyMan/security-team
LICENSE @SimplyLazyMan/legal-team

# Release management (requires multiple approvals)
.github/workflows/release.yml @SimplyLazyMan/release-team @SimplyLazyMan/security-team
package.json @SimplyLazyMan/release-team @SimplyLazyMan/security-team
```

## To Customize Your CODEOWNERS

1. **Create GitHub Teams** (if using team ownership):
   - Go to your organization settings
   - Create teams like `@SimplyLazyMan/core-team`, `@SimplyLazyMan/devops`, etc.
   - Add members to appropriate teams

2. **Edit the CODEOWNERS file**:
   - Replace `@SimplyLazyMan` with your team or additional usernames
   - Add specific rules for different file patterns
   - Test with pull requests to ensure it works

3. **Enable Branch Protection** (recommended):
   - Go to repository Settings â†’ Branches
   - Add protection rules requiring CODEOWNER reviews
   - This enforces that code owners must approve changes

## Testing CODEOWNERS

After setting up, test by:

1. Creating a pull request that modifies different file types
2. Verify that the correct owners are automatically requested for review
3. Check that the review requirements are enforced

## Benefits of Proper CODEOWNERS

- **Automatic Review Assignment**: No manual assignment needed
- **Expertise Routing**: Changes go to the right people
- **Quality Control**: Critical files get proper oversight  
- **Documentation**: Clear ownership boundaries
- **Compliance**: Audit trail of who reviewed what
